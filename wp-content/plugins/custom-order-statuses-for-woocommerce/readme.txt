Allows to create Custom Order Statuses for Woocommerce and send Custom Emails for them.

== Description ==
<strong>Custom Order Statuses for WooCommerce</strong> plugin greatly improves the organization of orders as well as the quality of customer service by allowing you to create Custom Order Statuses for Woocommerce and send custom emails when Order Status is changed to the created one (just like default Woocommerce Order Statuses behave).

<strong>Custom Order Statuses for WooCommerce features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited Custom Order Statuses</li>
<li>Custom Email Templates per Custom Order Status</li>
<li>Custom Email recipients (customer, particular recipient, multiple recipients)</li>
<li>Custom Email content</li>
<li>All Custom Order Statuses are accessible and editable from a single page</li>
<li>No visual and functional difference between Woocommerce default Order Statuses!</li>
</ul>

<strong>How to create your first Custom Order Status?</strong>

When you have successfully installed and activated the plugin, follow these steps to create your first Custom Order Status:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Wordpress->WooCommerce->Custom Order Statuses</li>
<li>Enter a name for your Custom Order Status</li>
<li>Enter a slug (if you want a different slug than generated)</li>
<li>Press “Add New Custom Order Status”</li>
<li>That’s it!</li>
</ol>

<strong>How to activate Email template for the created Custom Order Status?</strong>

By default Custom Order Statuses’ Email templates are disabled from sending, so in order to activate them you have to:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Wordpress->WooCommerce->Settings->Emails</li>
<li>Select the Email with the name of your Custom Order Status</li>
<li>Click on “Enable/Disable” checkbox</li>
<li>Fill in any other fields you want (optional)</li>
<li>Click on “Save Changes” and you are done!</li>
<li>P.S. You can copy email template to your theme folder and customize it as you like!</li>
</ol>
